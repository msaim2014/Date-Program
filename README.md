# Date program
Description: This program takes date inputs hard coded into main and checks to see if they are valid
dates. The default constructor initializes month, day, and year. The explicit value constructor
takes in each date and sets the variables and checks if it is a leap year. The get functions 
are accessors to output the variable. The set functions are mutators that change the function.
The display outputs the date while the operator<< overloads as friend function with chaining.
